                <name>Divine Sense</name>
                <text>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.</text>
                <text>    You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.</text>

                <text>Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level x 5.</text>
                <text>    As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.</text>
                <text>    Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.</text>
                <text>    This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.</text>

                <text>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</text>
                <text>• Protection</text>
                <text>When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.</text>

                <text>Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend.</text>

            <feature>
                <name>Spellcasting</name>
                <text>By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the paladin spell list.</text>
                <text />
                <text>Preparing and Casting Spells</text>
                <text>The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
                <text>    You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
                <text>    For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>
                <text>    You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</text>
                <text />
                <text>Spellcasting Ability</text>
                <text>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
                <text>    Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</text>
                <text>    Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</text>
                <text />
                <text>Spellcasting Focus</text>
                <text>You can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.</text>

				<name>Oath of the Ancients</name>
                <text>Tenets of the Ancients</text>
                <text>The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns of law or chaos. Its four central principles are simple.</text>
                <text>• Kindle the Light. Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the world, beating back despair.</text>
                <text>• Shelter the Light. Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness that would swallow it. Where life flourishes, stand against the forces that would render it barren.</text>
                <text>• Preserve Your Own Light. Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in your own heart, you can't preserve it in the world.</text>
                <text>• Be the Light. Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forth in all your deeds.</text>

				<name>Oath of Devotion</name>
                <text>Tenets of Devotion</text>
                <text>Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.</text>
                <text>• Honesty. Don't lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.</text>
                <text>• Courage. Never fear to act, though caution is wise.</text>
                <text>• Compassion. Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.</text>
                <text>• Honor. Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.</text>
                <text>• Duty. Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you.</text>
            </feature>
			<feature subclass="Sacred Oath: Oath of Vengeance">
				<name>Oath of Vengeance</name>
                <text>Tenets of Vengeance</text>
                <text>The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any means necessary. Paladins who uphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the paladins are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The core principles of the tenets are brutally simple.</text>
                <text>• Fight the Greater Evil. Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil. I choose the greater evil.</text>
                <text>• No Mercy for the Wicked. Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.</text>
                <text>• By Any Means Necessary. My qualms can't get in the way of exterminating my foes.</text>
                <text>• Restitution. If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed by their misdeeds.</text>

			<feature subclass="Oathbreaker">
				<name>Oathbreaker</name>
                <text>An Oathbreaker is a paladin who breaks his or her sacred oaths to pursue some dark ambition or serve an evil power. Whatever light burned in the paladin's heart has been extinguished. Only darkness remains.</text>
                <text>    A paladin must be evil and at least 3rd level to become an Oathbreaker. The paladin replaces the features specific to his or her Sacred Oath with Oathbreaker features.</text>

			<feature subclass="Sacred Oath: Oath of the Crown">
				<name>Oath of the Crown</name>
                <text>Tenets of the Crown</text>
                <text>The tenets of the Oath of the Crown are often set by the sovereign to which their oath is sworn, but generally emphasize the following tenets.</text>
                <text>• Law: The law is paramount. It is the mortar that holds the stones of civilization together, and it must be respected.</text>
                <text>• Loyalty: Your word is your bond. Without loyalty, oaths and laws are meaningless.</text>
                <text>• Courage: You must be willing to do what needs to be done for the sake of order, even in the face of overwhelming odds. If you don't act, then who will?</text>
                <text>• Responsibility: You must deal with the consequences of your actions, and you are responsible for fulfilling your duties and obligations. </text>
            </feature>
            <feature subclass="Sacred Oath: Oath of Conquest">
                <name>Tenets of Conquest</name>
                <text>A paladin who takes this oath has the tenets of conquest seared on the upper arm.</text>
                <text>• Douse the Flame of Hope: It is not enough to merely defeat an enemy in battle. Your victory must be so overwhelming that your enemies' will to fight is shattered forever. A blade can end a life. Fear can end an empire.</text>
                <text>• Rule with an Iron Fist: Once you have conquered, tolerate no dissent. Your word is law. Those who obey it shall be favored. Those who defy it shall be punished as an example to all who might follow. </text>
                <text>• Strength Above All: You shall rule until a stronger one arises. Then you must grow mightier and meet the challenge, or fall to your own ruin.</text>
            </feature>
            <feature subclass="Sacred Oath: Oath of Redemption">
                <name>Tenets of Redemption</name>
                <text>The tenets of the Oath of Redemption hold a paladin to a high standard of peace and justice.</text>
                <text>• Peace: Violence is a weapon of last resort. Diplomacy and understanding are the paths to long lasting peace.</text>
                <text>• Innocence: All people begin life in an innocent state, and it is their environment or the influence of dark forces that drives them to evil. By setting the proper example, and working to heal the wounds of a deeply flawed world, you can set anyone on a righteous path.</text>
                <text>• Patience: Change takes time. Those who have walked the path of the wicked must be given reminders to keep them honest and true. Once you have planted the seed of righteousness in a creature, you must work day after day to allow that seed to survive and flourish.</text>
                <text>• Wisdom: Your heart and mind must stay clear, for eventually you will be forced to admit defeat. While every creature can be redeemed, some are so far along the path of evil that you have no choice but to end their lives for the greater good. Any such action must be carefully weighed and the consequences fully understood, but once you have made the decision, follow through with it knowing your path is just.  </text>

                <text>You can use your Channel Divinity to invoke primeval forces to ensnare a foe. As an action, you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach for a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. The creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) or be restrained. While restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns.

                <text>• You have resistance to all damage.</text>
                <text>• When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as part of that action.</text>
                <text>• Your melee weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.</text>

                <text>At 20th level, you become an avatar of peace, which gives you two benefits:</text>
                <text>• You have resistance to all damage dealt by other creatures (their attacks, spells, and other effects).</text>
                <text>• Whenever a creature hits you with an attack, it takes radiant damage equal to half the damage you take from the attack. </text>
                <text>If you attack a creature, cast a spell on it, or deal damage to it by any means but this feature, neither benefit works against that creature until you finish a long rest. </text>
